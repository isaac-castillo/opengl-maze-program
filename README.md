This is my approach at using OpenGL and 3D graphics in C++.


The idea is that is an in progress-An implementation of mazes for use in 3D, although it has sort of morphed itself into an OpenGL playground and editor of sorts. 

Needless to say, there is no "maze" functionality yet.



uses:

- CMake
- C++17
- OpenGL
- OpenGL utilties (glfw, glew)
- DearImgui 

features:

- Various shaders
- Transformable OpenGL objects
- Moveable Camera
- Ability to create OpenGL objects
